1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC7950] defines the "anydata" statement to represent an
   unknown set of nodes that can be modeled with YANG at design time.
   However, YANG [RFC7950] left the verification of the "anydata" tree
   open to be done using external means.  Several IETF models, e.g.,
   [RFC7895], [RFC8526], [RFC9144], [RFC8639], [RFC8641], and [RFC8040],
   use "anydata" in their definitions.  Current YANG implementations
   accept syntactically valid YANG data nodes as children of an
   "anydata" node but do not check the semantics of these data nodes
   against a YANG schema.  This creates a real problem for any consumer
   of these models when validating all leaves of the YANG data tree.

   In this document we propese using YANG Library [RFC7895] to define
   the context in which anydata trees are validated.  This would require
   the YANG tooling to implement an optional flag that enables a strict
   mode validation for "anydata" in the context of a YANG library.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   We use the terminology defined in YANG [RFC7950] for schema node and
   schema tree but refine data node and data tree to be more precise.

   *  data node: A node in the schema tree that can be instantiated in a
      data tree.  One of container, leaf, leaf-list, list, anydata, and
      anyxml.  We do not discuss anyxml in this document, and this
      document does not change how YANG handles anyxml data nodes.

   *  instantiated data node: an instantiated instance of a data node
      that contains before fully qualified name (module namespace +
      identifier) for the data node and the data modeled within YANG.

   *  instantiated data tree: is what YANG [RFC7950] defines as "data
      tree".  Adding the term "instantiated" precisely indicates that
      this tree is an instance of specific data modeled with YANG.

   *  data tree: a tree of data nodes (with no values).

3.  Validating "anydata" Data Tree

   The current YANG encodings, XML, JSON, and CBOR, encode instantiated
   data nodes with fully qualified name using the module's namespace and
   a local name.  The module's namespace can be either explicit or
   assumed from a default namespace defined in the top data tree.

   This document introduces a new YANG validation option: anydata-
   strict-mode.  In this mode, a YANG data parser MUST accept a YANG
   library as input along the YANG data file.  When this option is
   enabled, any instantiated data node (B) that is a child of anydata
   node (A) is accepted to be valid only if the qualified name of the
   node A is found in one of the data trees defined by the YANG library
   AND the instantiated data tree rooted by A is valid according to the
   data node of A.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD
